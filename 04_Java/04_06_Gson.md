# 04_06 Gson (Json with Java)

## Packages

As of now, Json is not part of the default Java jdk.  However there are multiple packages that may be used.

* ***Jackson*** Jackson was the dominant package for a long time.
* ***Gson*** is an open source package from Google.

## Gson

* The best source of documentation is the github repo's [README.md file](https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/README.md);

From the README.md file:

### Goals

* Provide simple `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods to convert Java objects to JSON and vice-versa
* Allow pre-existing unmodifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON
* Extensive support of Java Generics
* Allow custom representations for objects
* Support arbitrarily complex objects (with deep inheritance hierarchies and extensive use of generic types)

The README.md file also has links to tutorials and maven/gradel dependencies.

## Getting the Jar file

Different methods:

* Manually download the .jar file 
* Clone the repository and do `mvn package`
* Include the dependency in Maven
