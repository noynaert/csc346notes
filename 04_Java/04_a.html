<h1>Installing Java on Linux</h1>

<p>These notes are linux-centric.  I will leave you on your own if you are on Windows or Mac.  But you aren't really left alone because there are many web pages that tell you how to do this.</p>

<p>I am also using a distro that is downstream from Ubuntu.  Most things should work in other distros, but you will need to change "apt" to something like "dnf" or "yum" in other distributions.</p>

<h2>Verify your version of Java</h2>

<p>First do the command <code>java -v</code> to see if you have Java and that it is at least v11.  Actually, I suspect anything after v9 will work, but I am using v11.</p>

<h2>Install Java using openJDK</h2>

<p><code>bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jdk
</code></p>

<h3>Install Oracle Java</h3>

<p>Oracle changed the licensing on their proprietary version of the Java JDK.  This has moved a lot of companies and universities to use of the openJDK version.  But if you want to run the Oracle version you may use the following if you are on Ubuntu 18.04 or later.  This part would be different for other distributions:</p>

<p><code>bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/java
sudo apt update
sudo apt install oracle-java11-installer
</code></p>

<h2>Checking Your System</h2>

<p>If you installed a new version of Java use the command <code>java -v</code> to verify your version.</p>

<p>If you have multiple versions of java installed you may have conflicts.  Verify that you have the correct version as the default with the command <code>which java</code>  If this shows the version you want, then you are good to go.  If it isn't we will fix it in the next step.</p>

<h2>Set JAVA_HOME</h2>

<p>Type the following command.</p>

<p><code>bash
sudo update-alternatives --config java
</code></p>

<p>If you only have the recently installed version you are good to move on.  If you have multiple versions installed you may need to follow the instructions so your system is using the correct version by default.</p>

<p>The update-alternatives command should show you the path you need to store in the JAVA_HOME environmental variable.  Copy it to the clipboard.</p>

<p>There are a lot of ways we could set the JAVA<em>HOME variable.  In this case you are running on a local machine, and anyone who logs in should be able to use the same JAVA</em>HOME.  Therefore it is reasonable to put the text in /etc/environment file.  You could use a command like the following:</p>

<p><code>bash
sudo nano /etc/environment
</code></p>

<p>Add a line like the following to the end of the file (in this case I am assuming openjdk-11, but use the appropriate value on your system). <em>Do not put blank spaces around the = sign.</em>  </p>

<p><code>bash
JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64"
</code></p>

<h2>Test it out at the command line</h2>

<p>It's a good idea to test your installation at the command line.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a new directory with the <code>mkdir</code> and move into it with the <code>cd</code> command.</li>
<li>use nano, vi, vim, or emacs to create a simple Java program.  </li>
</ul>
