## Commentary

I made these notes and videos 10 days ago (but I only uploaded two at the time).  

It is amazing how much can change in 10 days!  When I started these videos I expected to come back from
Spring break.  I thought some people would be staying away from school.  But I fully expected the semester to more or less go on as usual.

I have had to think a lot about how to do course completion.  I know I am going to have to cut way back from my original expection for the formal course completion.  I plan to do a second and more informal completion activity after the course is formally finished on April 24.

### Enrichment

One of my realizations is this would be more of a voluntary enrichment activity than a traditional course for a grade.  I had an opportunity to do enrichment as well.

### Do we still need VS Code and CLI?

In my original plan for the course we would be integrating Spring and Docker.  That was going to require some work with Java, Maven, and Docker at the command line.

But I am going to have to trim back the material we will cover in this class.  I am not sure the abbreviated content really needs a lot of manual Java and CLI.  But we will be needing the material if we continue beyond the end of the course.  Plus, I became somewhat intrigued by how far we can push VS Code.

I think we could move faster if we just dumped VS Code and jumped over to Intellij. But I think there is value in understanding what is going on under the hood in IntelliJ.  You may use either, but I am going to be using as much manual/VS Code work as possible in my videos.  But feel free to adapt it to Intellij, Eclipse, or Netbeans.

## Assignments for 04_00 through 04_05

I don't plan on making an assignment on this material.  It should be review for a lot of people.  I know I covered a lot of this material in my CSC 254.  Therefore the majority of people in this class will have seen this material.  Everyone is free to just watch the videos, maybe at double speed.  Or skip through the material you already know.  

I encourage anyone who wants to do some hands-on work to replicate what I did. Or, even better, pick another table in the misc database and reproduce the program using data from a different table.

I hope by Friday to release a video showing a better way to connect with a database.  It is a step toward the Spring Framework.  There will be an assignment there.
