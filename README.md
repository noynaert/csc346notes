## Command Line display of MarkDown files

* Install "pandoc" to translate the files from markdown to html
* Install the w3m command-line web browser
* Use the mdd.sh script (included) to display the markdown file in a text window.

This utility was written to allow the notes to be displayed in a narrow frame using the i3 windows manager.
